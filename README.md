Sven Co-op Low-Def Pack - For Sven Co-op
========================================

Restoring the look of classic Sven.

About
-----

This is a Low-Def Pack for Sven Co-op. It's pretty much a copy and paste of
SC 3.0 and stock Half-Life models and sounds. Only the base content is 
meant to be replaced, so don't be surprised if custom maps look out of 
place trying to match the "SD" content of normal Sven.

The goal was to restore the look and feel back to the good old days of Sven
Co-op 3.0, and to create/modify content to replace new models since 3.0. It
adds back stock sounds for weapons and walking as well.

Installation
------------

Put the contents of this folder (excluding this text file) into:

	steamapps/common/Sven Co-op/svencoop_addon/

That simple.

It is **highly recommended** that you install **ONLY** to the above folder,
otherwise uninstallation will be a nightmare. Not to mention other
possible compatibility issues may occur.

Extras
-------------------

### Models for Cut Maps

These are models for the maps that were sadly cut from 5.0, untested so
beware! To install them, simply move the models folder into your addons
folder as mentioned above.

### 3.0 Menu

A simple copy and paste for the old Steam Menu from Sven Co-op 3.0. Purely
for nostalgia. Again, to install, place the "resource" folder in the above
mentioned addons folder.
